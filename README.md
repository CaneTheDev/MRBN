## Overview

MRBN is a novel blockchain protocol designed to enable meaningful participation from low-resource devices (laptops, desktops, small VPS) while maintaining Byzantine fault tolerance and economic security.

Unlike Proof-of-Work (favoring industrial mining) or Proof-of-Stake (favoring capital concentration), MRBN introduces a **Micro-Resource Based Validation Model** where validators contribute small amounts of CPU, RAM, and storage.

## Key Features

- **Equal Entry Barrier**: Resource caps prevent vertical scaling advantages
- **Probabilistic Fairness**: VRF-based random committee selection
- **Sybil Resistance**: Without requiring stake or capital
- **Micro-Task Parallelism**: Transaction validation split among small committees
- **Economic Inclusivity**: Meaningful rewards for small contributors

## Node Requirements

| Resource | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| RAM | 1 GB |
| CPU | Configurable max time per task |
| Storage | 500 MB – 1 GB |
| Network | Persistent connection |
